    <p>Through the millennia, society has learned the best way to govern the people is for the people to govern
      themselves. In this spirit, InvocationsOnline is here to assure/ensure <strong><em>ALL</em></strong> citizens are
      included in the ceremonial
      portion of <strong><em>OUR</em></strong> local government meetings.</p>

    <p>Put simply, if an invocation will be the part of a governing meeting, it must include opportunities for all
      people&mdash;of any religious affiliation or god beliefs. We do not democratically choose a religion as a
      city, town, or county, and we may not democratically choose who will conduct invocations on our behalf. This must
      be an open process with no barriers to entry for anyone.</p>

    <p>Find more about your local government meetings including how to offer your own invocation at
      the <%= link_to 'Locations', localities_path %>
      page.</p>

    <p>Join our team and help us collect invocation data in your area at
      our <%= link_to 'Volunteer', page_path('volunteer') %> page. Itâ€™s much easier than you
      think.</p>
