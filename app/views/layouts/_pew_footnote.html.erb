      <small>* The data from Pew has been simplified for graphical representation as follows: Responses in the
        categories
        of
        'Other Christian' and 'Other World Religion' have been combined into 'Other Religion'. Unaffiliated has been
        changed
        to 'None'. Responses in the category of 'Donâ€™t Know/Refused' have been added to 'None'. The responses Mormon,
        Buddhist, and Hindu which were originally <0.5 have been rounded up to 0.5 each.
